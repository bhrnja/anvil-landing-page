# Anvil Co. Landing Page

## Landing page project for the Anvil Company.

This project is part of the TOP curriculum. I've gone ahead and setup my own company for this project, where I designed the logo and wrote the content.

### About

Anvil Co. is a devised company created for the purposes of this project. They are an eCommerce store that sells athletic footwear.

### Goal

The goal with this project is to combine my learned HTML and CSS skills to create a professional landing page. The page maintains responsiveness and highlights core design skills such as layout, color, and typography.
